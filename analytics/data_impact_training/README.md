# Analytics Track Data Impact Training Homework

The homework for this week will consist of creating Tableau dashboards to create visualizations of a data set you are particularly passionate about.

If you can't think of one, you can consider using the EcZachly clickstream events data included in this repo, or the Halo medals data set included in a prior week.

- Make two dashboards with Tableau public
  - an executive dashboard that illustrates different stuff than in the lab
  - an exploratory dashboard with filters
  
You will publish your dashboard on Tableau public, and your submission will consist of the share link to the dashboard.
