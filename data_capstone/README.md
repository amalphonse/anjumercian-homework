# City Data Dashboard Project

### Goal of the Project

This project is for a Data Engineer.io bootcamp capstone project. I am building a public dashboard to replicate the website 
https://www.city-data.com/; instead of the data dump, my goal is to have a dashboard with graphs and charts that is 
more visually appealing, so for example, anyone looking to move to and live in San Jose City in California they would get a dashboard with statistics that represents the crime rates, the property worth, the homelessness rate, the rental situation. The expected output will be a dashboard that would showcase the comparison of property rates across different features of a home, like for a 3 bedroom 2 bath house, the price and the sqft, and also the crime rates comparison to different cities in a particular state.

The project follows the following steps:

-Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data 
-Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data 
-Step 3: Define the Data Model 
-Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data 
-Step 5: Conclusion
