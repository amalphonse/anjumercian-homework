## Data Schemas/Modeling

[Document the schemas of the tables that will be generated by your pipeline in markdown tables. See this example:]

| Column        | Data Type | Description                                                              |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| date          | DATE     | Date of the weather                                                      |
| weather_type  | TEXT     | Derived type based on the amount of precipitation in a day               |
| precipitation | REAL     | Amount of precipitation in a day (in mm)                                 |

[Note that you must include at least one fact and one dimension table]

[Pro tip: use ChatGPT to generate the markdown for these tables.]

## Data Quality Checks

[Document the data quality checks that will be applied to each column from your schemas via a markdown table. See this example:]

| Column        | Data Quality Check                                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| date          | Ensure values are in YYYY-MM-DD format.              |
| weather_type  | Ensure values are non-null and within expected list.|
| precipitation | Ensure values are non-negative and numeric.         |
