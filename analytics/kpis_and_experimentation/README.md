# Analytics Track KPIs and Experimentation Homework

This week the homework is going to be around writing down KPIs and analyzing how to set them for new features on products that we are already users for.

We have included a template submission file for you to fill out to submit your homework for this week.

We'll ask you to include the following in the submission:

- pick a product that you love using (spotify, linkedin, etc)
- describe the user journey of the things you loved about it from the moment you started using it to your use of it now
- describe **3** experiments you would like to run on this product to see if it would improve the experience
  - specify the allocation of each of the test cells and the conditions youâ€™re testing
  - Your hypothesis of which leading and lagging metrics would be impacted by this experiment.
